### What I learned

I think I've done a great job on this solution compared to my previous solutions. I've finally got rid off
excessively using divs and h1 for my html content. And have used proper html tags for each use. Although
I still think there are a lot to improve, this is a great step for me.

My CSS (tailwind) has also been more responsive thanks to an approach done by Kevin Powell.
